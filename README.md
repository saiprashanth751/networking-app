## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* React, TypeScript, Vite
* Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
* react-router-dom, Axios, React Toastify
* Socket.IO Client, SimpleBar React

**Backend**

* Node.js (Express), TypeScript
* Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
* JWT, bcrypt, Nodemailer
* Socket.IO, Multer, CORS
* Cloudinary for media storage

**Deployment**

* Frontend: Vercel
* Backend: Render

**Integrations**

* LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces, GitHub stats via third-party cards

## Architecture

Connect! follows a monorepo structure with two core services:

* **Frontend (React + Vite)**: SPA that interacts with the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time features.
* **Backend (Express + TypeScript)**: RESTful API layer, authentication, business logic, database interactions via Prisma, and real-time channels via Socket.IO.

Data flows through HTTP for CRUD operations and WebSockets for messaging. Uploaded media is processed by Multer and stored in Cloudinary.
